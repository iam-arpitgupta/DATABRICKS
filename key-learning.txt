# for the preprocessing we havse used both the pandas and the pyspark 
firstly we have use the pandas for the preprocessing 
nd then we have converted into the spark session for creating a catalog 


# reason to generate synthetic data 
In most production-grade projects, you'll generate synthetic data for these key reasons:
Robust Testing (CI/CD): This is the biggest reason. You cannot run your automated tests on your full production dataset every time a developer changes a line of code. It's too slow, expensive, and may expose sensitive data. Synthetic data provides a small, fast, and safe "crash test dummy" for your code.
Simulating Data Drift: Your model's performance will degrade if the real-world data changes. By generating data with intentional "drift," you can test your monitoring systems to make sure they'll alert you when the model starts to fail in the real world.
Handling Imbalanced Data: If you're predicting a rare event (like equipment failure or financial fraud), you might have very few real examples. Generating realistic synthetic examples of the rare class can help you train a more accurate model.
Testing Edge Cases: Your real data might not contain weird or unexpected values. You can generate these edge cases to see how your model behaves and prevent it from breaking in unexpected ways.
